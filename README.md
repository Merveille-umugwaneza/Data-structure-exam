Digital Catalog for Home Appliances

Project Overview

The Digital Catalog for Home Appliances is a data management system designed to efficiently store, organize, and retrieve information about various home appliances. This system leverages advanced data structures such as Singly Linked List, Circular Linked List, Heap, Tree Structure, Deque, and Sorting Algorithms to ensure optimal performance and functionality.

Features

Dynamic Management: Add, update, and delete appliance entries dynamically.

Search and Retrieval: Retrieve appliance details efficiently using tree structures.

Sorting: Organize appliance data based on multiple criteria (e.g., price, brand, rating).

Queue and Deque Operations: Manage prioritized tasks like appliance maintenance scheduling.

Circular Linked Lists: Maintain continuous and repeatable traversal of related appliance categories.

Heap Operations: Efficiently manage and retrieve the highest or lowest priority appliances.

Data Structures Used

1. Singly Linked List

Used for basic catalog management where entries are dynamically added and removed.

Ensures linear traversal for operations such as displaying appliance details.

2. Circular Linked List

Used to represent appliance categories that require cyclic navigation, ensuring seamless transitions between categories.

3. Heap

A Min-Heap or Max-Heap is used to prioritize appliances based on attributes like price or energy efficiency.

Enables efficient retrieval of top-priority elements.

4. Tree Structure

A binary search tree (BST) or similar hierarchical structure is implemented for efficient searching and sorting.

Used for storing appliances with quick lookup capabilities.

5. Deque

Supports double-ended operations, enabling flexible addition and removal of tasks or appliances from both ends.

6. Sorting Algorithms

Implemented to arrange appliances based on user-defined attributes such as price, name, or rating.

Algorithms like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, or Heap Sort are utilized.
